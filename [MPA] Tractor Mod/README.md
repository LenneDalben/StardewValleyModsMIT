# [MPA] Tractor Mod
This mod adds an app for the Tractor on the phone, so that you're able to summon the tractor from the phone. Requires SMAPI, Tractor Mod, and Mobile Phone to be installed.


||Background||

<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6523">Mobile Phone</a> is excellent for many reasons, but one of the added benefits is that it allows you to free up some keybinds by creating an app for a mod that uses a keybind. Check out the optional files on the Mobile Phone app for others!

Additionally, the keybind doesn't do anything before you have the tractor, so, similarly, clicking the app before you have the tractor also does nothing.


||Installation||
1. Install <a href="https://smapi.io/">SMAPI</a> (version 3.7.2 or higher)
2. Install <a href= "https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1401">Tractor Mod</a> (version 4.11.2 or higher) and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6523">Mobile Phone</a>
3. <a href="https://github.com/LenneDalben/StardewValleyModsMIT/releases/">Download the mod</a> unzip the mod folder into Stardew Valley/Mods
4. Play the game using SMAPI!


||Uninstallation||

Delete the folder from this mod.
